release info
------------

This is version 1.0.1 of xmlrpclib.py.

This version fixes a number of minor bugs, and adds optional support
for xmlToolkit's xmlrpc accelerator (currently not included in the
free distribution).  It also loads xmllib and other support libraries
only when needed, to speed up the initial import.

This is beta software.  There are no known bugs.

The XML-RPC specification can be found at:

	http://www.xml-rpc.com

The sgmlop parser can be used to speed up this library 10-15x.  The
parser can be found at:

	http://www.pythonware.com/products/xml/sgmlop.htm

Comments, bug reports, and patches are welcome.  Send them to:

	fredrik@pythonware.com

Note that this is free software, with limited support.  If you need
commercial support on this module, please contact info@pythonware.com.
